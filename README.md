# 🧠 Custom CPU Instruction Set Tasks

This repository demonstrates a range of low-level operations implemented on a custom-designed CPU model. It showcases how fundamental instructions like addition, jumps, logical operations, and memory access work together to simulate core CPU behavior.

Each directory represents a progressively more complex task set, from constructing a base machine to integrating full instruction flow. These tasks are designed to reinforce concepts like instruction execution, branching, condition handling, and control flow at the architectural level.

## ⚙️ Key Concepts Covered

- **Instruction Set Design**: Custom opcode simulation  
- **Control Unit Logic**: Conditional execution, jump logic  
- **Memory Access**: Direct and indirect addressing  
- **ALU Operations**: Arithmetic and logical functions  
- **Flags & Condition Codes**: SNA, SPA, ISZ, etc.  
- **Micro-operations**: Step-by-step instruction breakdown


## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **CPUSim** or similar CPU simulation tool  
- Custom instruction formats (assembly-like syntax)  
- Manual control of fetch–decode–execute cycle
