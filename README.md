# üß† Custom CPU Instruction Set Tasks

This repository demonstrates a range of low-level operations implemented on a custom-designed CPU model. It showcases how fundamental instructions like addition, jumps, logical operations, and memory access work together to simulate core CPU behavior.

Each directory represents a progressively more complex task set, from constructing a base machine to integrating full instruction flow. These tasks are designed to reinforce concepts like instruction execution, branching, condition handling, and control flow at the architectural level.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Concepts Covered

- **Instruction Set Design**: Custom opcode simulation  
- **Control Unit Logic**: Conditional execution, jump logic  
- **Memory Access**: Direct and indirect addressing  
- **ALU Operations**: Arithmetic and logical functions  
- **Flags & Condition Codes**: SNA, SPA, ISZ, etc.  
- **Micro-operations**: Step-by-step instruction breakdown


## üõ† Technologies Used

- **CPUSim** or similar CPU simulation tool  
- Custom instruction formats (assembly-like syntax)  
- Manual control of fetch‚Äìdecode‚Äìexecute cycle  


## üìÑ Documentation

A step-by-step walkthrough of each task can be found in:

**`Instruction Guide.pdf`**

This guide contains details on how each instruction was implemented and tested, along with key observations and expected behavior.
